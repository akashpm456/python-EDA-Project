# # Exploratory Data Analysis on NYC Airbnb 2019 dataset 
# 
# 
# 
# ## Introduction 
# 
# ### The data from this analysis is from Kaggle New York City Airhub Open Data. The data describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC , Ny for 2012includes information such as the location of the listing properties , the neighborhood of the properties , room type, price, minimum rights required review and availability of the listing/
# 
# ### The Purpose of this analysis is to perform, exploratory data analysis as well as data visualization to understand how different fators influence the listing properties on Airbnb and ultimately  to make predicstions on the availability of the listing properties.
# 
# ### The following questioms will be answered on the course of this analysis.
# 
# * Where are the most of the properties listed smf where is the busiest areas?
# * what type of rooms are most popular? 
# * How different area/neighborhood affect the listing property price and demands?
# * What are the most important factors when customer choose an airbnb property 
#   - Price 
#   - Location
#   - Room Type 
#   - Customer Review
#   
#   ## Data loading and Processing 
#   
#   ### We start the analysys by importing necessary libraries and loading the data . The libraries used in this analysis are 
#   
#   #### - Pandas
#   #### - Numpy
#   #### - Matplotlib
#   #### - Seaborn 
#   #### - Sklearn 
#   #### - statsmodels
#

# conclusion: 
# Throught this analysis,we have a better idea on the key factors that influences the demand of an airbnb listing property.Tourists/customers prefer location close to downtown, lower price and entire room which offers them more privacy when toring the city.These can all be taken into consideration for airbnb hosts when posting their properties online.
